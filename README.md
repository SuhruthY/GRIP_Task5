# Color Detection using Python: [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SuhruthY/GRIP_Task5/blob/master/color_detection.ipynb) 
 
## Overview 
&emsp;The task aims to detect colors of a given image by the user. I have use Python cv2 module, numpy, pyplot from matplotlib and sklearn to do the job. 

## Procedure
&emsp;Firstly we will see how to open the image using the cv2 module and the convert it the appropriate format. Then  we will cluster the color and find out the top clusters and plot a pie chart.

## Conclusion 
&emsp;I constrained the project to only detecting the color. You can also search, match and filter images based on color.
